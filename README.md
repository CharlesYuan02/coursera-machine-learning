# Coursera Machine Learning
My notes and code that I wrote while taking Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. Or, more specifically, the notes are entirely hand-written by me, but most of the code was already prepared beforehand. I've been meaning to take this course for a while now, and I finally see why it's so acclaimed. It definitely helped me strengthen my foundational knowledge of machine learning.

## Topics Covered
**Week 1:** Supervised learning, linear regression, cost function, gradient descent.

**Week 2:** Multivariate linear regression, feature scaling, mean normalization, learning rate, the Normal Equation.

**Week 3:** Logistic regression, linear/non-linear decision boundaries, binary/multiclass classification, overfitting, regularization.

**Week 4:** Neural networks, logical operators, one-vs-all, non-linear classification.

**Week 5:** Forward propagation, backpropagation, random initialization.

**Week 6:** Precision/Recall, F1 score, bias/variance, trainining/validation/testing split.

**Week 7:** Support vector machines, kernels.

**Week 8:** Unsupervised learning, K-means clustering, dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis.

**Week 9:** Anomaly detection, content-based recommender systems, collaborative filtering recommender systems.

**Week 10:** Stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, online/continuous learning, map-reduce.

**Week 11:** Photo OCR, artificial data synthesis, ceiling analysis.
